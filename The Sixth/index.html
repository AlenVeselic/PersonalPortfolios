                        I’ve mostly been focusing on frontend, trying to build my fundamental knowledge of html,
                        css and javascript. Besides that I also had a bit of a craving for scripting

                    <p class="backStory">
                        Ever since I was a child I was fascinated with computers. I was introduced to computers back when I was 6 and we used to visit my cousins, I’d watch them play video games astounded at what I was seeing. Soon our family would borrow a pc from them and I’d come to realise that there was far more to these magic game boxes than just video games.
                        <br><br>
                        I’d be immersed in them throughout elementary and after that when the decision was to be made where I would continue my journey in education I decided to go for the “Tehnik Računalništva” program at the nearby Computer Science secondary school. 
                        <br><br>
                        This program’s emphasis was programming. Here I spent 4 years learning the basics of computer science. In general this started off with hardware, the history of computer science, planning a task out with flow charts and ended up with us programming a full stack shop, mobile applications in android studio, command line scripts in c++ and various databases in postgreSQL. 
                        <br><br>
                        Having successfully graduated from secondary school along with finishing some extra  credits to get into my uni program of choice I thought I’d give university the good old college try. That didn’t go so well and I decided to drop out after the first year. This, however, did not dash my dream to work in development.
                        <br><br>
                        Being a dropout, in the countryside where there was little to no demand for junior developers I realised I needed to get a job outside my field and continue my pursuit to further my dream outside of work hours.
                        I got a job as an automatic press worker in a nearby aluminum factory. My plan was to use the funds from this job to become independent and continue studying development, while still hunting for jobs in the field. The field I decided to focus on was web development.
                        <br><br>
                        Eventually I got a car, moved out into a city with more opportunity and grew a lot as a person.
                        <br><br>
                        Recently I learned a new programming language named Python. Started a new schedule, dividing each month into job hunting and studying development.
                        <br><br>
                        I am still determined to one day break into the field and when I do I will be very happy, because that will mean that I will get to develop both as a job and at home, allowing me to work on my skills as a developer twofold.
                        <br><br>
