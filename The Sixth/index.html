                <p>I am a web developer, who wishes to broaden his knowledge on development and create/contribute
                    to projects which would in the end satisfy clients and end users.
                    
                    I’ve mostly been focusing on frontend, trying to build my fundamental knowledge of html,
                    css and javascript. Besides that I also had a bit of a craving for scripting 
                    languages so I decided to tackle Python recently. Currently looking for a mentorship 
                    since It feels like I need some guidance in getting my skills to an employable level
                    and marketing myself on the job market.

                </button>
                <p class="backStory">
                    Ever since I was a child I was fascinated with computers. I was introduced to computers back when I was 6 and we used to visit my cousins, I’d watch them play video games astounded at what I was seeing. Soon our family would borrow a pc from them and I’d come to realise that there was far more to these magic game boxes than just video games.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d be immersed in them throughout elementary and after that when the decision was to be made where I would continue my journey in education I decided to go for the “Tehnik Računalništva” program at the nearby Computer Science secondary school. 
                    <br><br>
                    This program’s emphasis was programming. Here I spent 4 years learning the basics of computer science. In general this started off with hardware, the history of computer science, planning a task out with flow charts and ended up with us programming a full stack shop, mobile applications in android studio, command line scripts in c++ and various databases in postgreSQL. 
                    <br><br>
                    Having successfully graduated from secondary school along with finishing some extra  credits to get into my uni program of choice I thought I’d give university the good old college try. That didn’t go so well and I decided to drop out after the first year. This, however, did not dash my dream to work in development.
                    <br><br>
                    Being a dropout, in the countryside where there was little to no demand for junior developers I realised I needed to get a job outside my field and continue my pursuit to further my dream outside of work hours.
                    I got a job as an automatic press worker in a nearby aluminum factory. My plan was to use the funds from this job to become independent and continue studying development, while still hunting for jobs in the field. The field I decided to focus on was web development.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually I got a car, moved out into a city with more opportunity and grew a lot as a person.
                    <br><br>
                    Recently I learned a new programming language named Python. Started a new schedule, dividing each month into job hunting and studying development.
                    <br><br>
                    I am still determined to one day break into the field and when I do I will be very happy, because that will mean that I will get to develop both as a job and at home, allowing me to work on my skills as a developer twofold.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        If you’ve read this far, I’d like to thank you for reading my story and wish you a good day.
